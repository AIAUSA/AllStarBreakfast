  text: "<h2>The Bart Starr Award </h2><p>The Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award
    was created to honor the NFL player who best exemplifies outstanding character
    and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. The Award is named
    after Bart Starr who, in addition to being in the NFL Hall of Fame, was selected
    as MVP in Super Bowls I and II. Mr. Starr is an individual of impeccable character
    who has served his family and community faithfully through the years and is a
    role model for athletes and business people alike. </p><p>Nominees are gathered
    from the Public Relations Directors of each NFL team, the past winners of the
    Bart Starr Award, the Athletes in Action Pro Staff working with NFL teams and
    Bart Starr. Ballots are sent to each team and voting takes place at the same time
    as the Pro Bowl selections. The votes are tabulated and the winner is announced
    at the annual Super Bowl Breakfast. </p><p>In 1988, Athletes in Action held its
    inaugural Super Bowl Breakfast at Super Bowl XXII in San Diego, CA. In 1989, the
    first <strong><em>Bart Starr Award</em></strong> was presented at the Super Bowl
    Breakfast. Bart Starr agreed to partner with Athletes in Action to present this
    award in his name. He is present each year at the Breakfast to personally present
    the Award to the winner voted on by NFL players.</p>"
