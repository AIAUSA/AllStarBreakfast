  content: "**The All-Star Moms Champion Outreach takes place during NBA All-Star
    Weekend at the Annual All-Star Breakfast, hosted by Athletes in Action and the
    National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA).** \n\n* _1 in 4 children
    under the age of 18 — a total of about 17.2 million — are being raised without
    a father_\n* The pressures of a single income, high costs of childcare, finding
    the time and energy to raise their children and feed their families is a constant
    battle where the risk of poverty for these families is the tragic reality\n* Despite
    the need, many of these mothers will avoid asking for help in order to maintain
    a sense of dignity and independence. \n\n**The key goal of the All-Star Moms Champion
    Outreach is to recognize the undertakings of courageous single-mothers and create
    an A-level occasion to uniquely applaud their efforts and connect them with pertinent
    resources within their community.** "

    of the All-Star Moms Champion Outreach. A national speaker and author of the book
    entitled; Unfavorable Odds, Kim was inspired by watching her own mother overcome
    the difficulties of being the sole provider for her family. As a result, she developed
    a passion to encourage single moms in similar situations to overcome the obstacles
    they face and pursue a life of purpose. You can read more about Kim at www.KimAnthony.net.</em></p>"
