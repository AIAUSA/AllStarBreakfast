Cris Carter, the 1995 recipient of the Bart Starr Award, is referred to many as “Mr. Clutch”, given his ability to make key receptions. In 1999, he became only the second player to catch 1,000 passes putting him into the history books alongside Jerry Rice. Carter ranks second on the NFL’s all-time list for total receptions (1,093) and receiving touchdowns (129). He was selected as the 1999 NFL Man of the Year.

Cris established the Carter-White Charitable Foundation for underprivileged children and created the Viking Super Challenge to help kids stay in school and away from drugs.
