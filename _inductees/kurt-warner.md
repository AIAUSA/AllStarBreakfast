A four time Pro Bowl selection, Warner has won two NFL MVP awards and one Super Bowl. After stints in both the Arena Football League and NFL Europe, Warner joined the St. Louis Rams in 1998 and became the starting quarterback during the 1999-2000 season. Warner threw 41 touchdown passes and led the Rams to a Super Bowl XXXIV victory over the Tennessee Titans. He was the 1999 Super Bowl and League MVP, joining Bart Starr and four others who have earned both awards in the same year. Warner led the Rams to another Super Bowl in 2002, and was again named the League MVP. Warner signed with the Giants in June 2004 before being signed by the Arizona Cardinals in 2005. Warner led the Cardinals to the Super Bowl in 2009, where they were defeated by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Warner has recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, has the 2nd highest average passing yards per game (260.4 yds/game), the highest completion percentage in a regular season single game (92.3%) and is the only quarterback to throw for over 14,000 yards for two different teams.

Warner and his wife Brenda established the First Things First Foundation as a public charity in 2001 to promote Christian values and bless the lives of those less fortunate with projects such as trips to Disney World for ill children, building recreation centers in children’s hospitals, rewarding single parents as they achieve the dream of homeownership and teaching Special Olympians the football basics. All projects are centered on Kurt’s life theme of putting faith and family first. With their varied personal experiences used as the compass to guide the direction of the work of First Things First, the Warners have actively initiated more than twelve on-going projects which affect people in communities in Phoenix, St. Louis, and Iowa. Taking inventory of Kurt Warner’s tireless philanthropy paints a picture of a man who knows that his purpose in life is bigger than throwing touchdowns and winning Super Bowls.

Kurt and Brenda and their seven children live in Arizona.
