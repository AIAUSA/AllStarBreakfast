John Lynch of the Denver Broncos is the winner of the 2007 Bart Starr Award. A 14th-year safety, Lynch is one of the most decorated active NFL players with seven Pro Bowl selections. Before joining the Broncos as a free agent in 2004, he spent the first 11 years of his NFL career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Lynch served as a key leader of the 2002 Buccaneers, helping the team to a victory in Super Bowl XXXVII against the Raiders in a game played in his hometown of San Diego. He posted at least one interception in each of the last 11 seasons (1995-2005), a streak that is the longest among NFL safeties and second longest among all players.

John and Linda Lynch formed the John Lynch Foundation in August 2000 to provide encouragement and positive alternatives for young people. In a time when violence and irresponsibility seem to be glorified, the Lynches are determined to reach students and instill in them the drive to become effective community leaders by encouraging dreams, providing programs that assist and motivate and recognizing achievement and excellence. Programs include John Lynch Salutes the Stars, John Lynch Star of the Month, Lynchâ€™s Leaders, Legacy Scholarships and Christmas Party.

John and his wife Linda live in Denver with their three children and are expecting a fourth child in March.
