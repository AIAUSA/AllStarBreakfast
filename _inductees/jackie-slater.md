Jackie Slater, the 1996 recipient of the Bart Starr Award, was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the third round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Slater is tied for third all time for the most seasons played in the history of the league. His 259 regular-season games played are also the most ever by an offensive lineman, and his 20 seasons with one team is an NFL record. A veteran of 18 playoff games, including Super Bowl XIV, Slater was a model of consistent superlative play and was widely regarded as one of the game’s premier linemen. In 2001, Jackie Slater was inducted in the NFL Hall of Fame.

Jackie’s community service includes assisting the United Negro College Fund to help Africa-Americans and other minority students receive a higher education
