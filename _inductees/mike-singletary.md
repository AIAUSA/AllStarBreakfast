Mike Singletary, the 1991 recipient of the Bart Starr Award, was a second round draft pick of the Chicago Bears in the 1981 NFL draft. In his first season, Singletary earned NFL defensive rookie of the year honors. As a middle linebacker, Singletary played in Super Bowl XX and his 10 Pro Bowl selections are a Chicago record and his career 172 starts are second only to the late Walter Payton. He led the NFL as Defensive Player of the Year three times and was the Bears’ team captain for 10 years. He was inducted in the NFL Hall of Fame in 1995.

Since his retirement in 1993, this superstar athlete has turned his trademark intensity on the world of business, helping organizations increase their competitive edge and make the winning play. He speaks about teamwork, about developing a winning attitude and about the responsibilities of leadership.. His book, Daddy’s Home at Last: What It Takes to Put Families First, speaks directly to parents about how important they are to their children and how they can successfully juggle family and career.
