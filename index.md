    ###### All-Star Moms

    As a service to the local community, Athletes in Action has created The All-Star Moms Champion Outreach, which occurs in conjunction with the All-Star Breakfast. It is designed to champion disadvantaged single moms, by delivering a rare opportunity for support and encouragement with an exclusive All-Star experience. The aim is to encourage these moms to continue strong in the demanding journey of single parenting.
